Hi there person I've probably never met before! (Hopefully?)

### Welcome to this wonderful blog of mine!

So, what's this place about? Tagline says it all, an attempt in blogging. Second attempt actually, the first one kinda went downhill and spiraled into neglect. What's to prevent this one from doing the same? Well, nothing actually. But in all likelihood, it won't. For I believe in second chances and so should you.

But seriously, what is this blog about? That's kinda why I clicked the "about" button so I wanna know. Let me tell ya this then, it's about me writing whatever I want to write about with regards to my life and how I chose to live it.

Please note that post quality and content vary with season despite me living on a not-so-exotic tropical island. The unofficial posting schedule was biweekly (up to the reader for interpretation) but I'm changing that to every Wednesday. Note that the posting schedule is also seasonal so don't expect 100% consistency.

### About the author

So who am I? Just some random dude on the internet. Totally unremarkable, fresh out of college and does the not-so-usual 8 to 5 job on weekdays, spends most of my precious free time tryna learn stuff and do cool things with my life instead. My interests keep changing but so far, I think I'm doing great! 

My motto for life, live it the way you want it. Don't actually know how you want to live your life? What a coincidence, neither do I! That's exactly why I'm wasting my time trying out new things and picking up different interests along the way.

If you don't know what you're doing or what you want to do, then follow me and watch me not know what I'm doing or want to do. Learn from my mistakes and repeat them. Yes, repeat them so you can learn from them as your very own mistakes. Or just learn directly from my mistakes but I take credit for all my mistakes so don't go telling people it's your mistake.

If you do know what you're doing or what you want to do, then follow me anyway for you get to watch me do stupid things and have a good laugh about it! Maybe even tell your friends so they too can join the laugh. After all, laughter is the best medicine and I do like the thought of having an army of laughing hyenas follow me around under my control, even if they're laughing at me.

Please feel free to contact me using the following email. That's bk_7312, followed by a weird letter that's kinda like a "half-a-half-o-hybrid", followed by hotmail, then a dot, and a com. Sigh, the lengths I go to just to make my email a bit more obscured...
