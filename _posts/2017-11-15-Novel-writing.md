title: National Novel Writing Month 2017
---

The glorious month of November, also known as the National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo for short. It's an internet-based project where the goal is to get participants to write a novel of about 50,000 words long during the whole 30 days of November. The point is to get writers to write, with the focus being on length rather than quality and the idea is to get at least a first draft up ready by the end of the month. All the fine-tuning and nitty-gritty editing can come later. And as we reach the halfway mark, guess who decided to join!

So I need a title, a genre, and a story synopsis. What's left is to actually write my novel. What have I got? Well, there was that prologue to a nameless story I once wrote a while back. The one thing I learned from it is to never write a story third-person ever again. It's so much easier to do first-person, which is exactly what I'll do. This is the story that I had in mind:

"We have arrived, young master."

The shining light blinded my eyes as we left the tunnel and into the light. I find myself standing in front of a room, about 7 steps wide and 9 steps long. From the ceiling, a bright white light shines upon the room, making the already white walls even more blinding to the eye.

As my eyes adjust, I see that the room is barely furnished. On the far corner, there are two couches placed at right angles to each other. In front of them is a fancy little coffee table. To my right, there's a couple of plastic chairs and a small round table. As I spread my gaze across the room, I'm hit by an odd sense of familiarity. 

I turn my head and face the person who was guiding me up until now. He was standing silently by the door, watching me. I tried to call out to him but words remain stuck in my throat as I struggled to say something.

"Please, have a sit young master. You must be parched, would you like something to drink?"

I nodded in acknowledgment and sat on one of the many plastic chairs. 

"Why did you sit there young master?"

Seeing my startled expression, Ziel quickly corrected himself.

"Or rather, of all the seats available, why have you chosen to sit there young master?" 

That's right, Ziel was his name. How did I not remember that until just a few moments ago? But who is he? Somehow, I feel like it would be imprudent to ask so I kept quiet. 

"You could have chosen to sit on the couch, which would no doubt be several times more comfortable than that wretched chair you are currently sitting on."

Did he have something against plastic chairs? Well, the sofa is quite far away whereas the plastic chairs are just to my right. Besides, I don't see what the problem is here.

"But at the very least, why did you choose to sit at such an awkward corner young master? Why did you not choose to sit, say, on the chair nearest to you?"

Huh? Now that he mentioned it, why did I choose this seat? Somehow, I just sat here on a whim. There's no reason to choose one seat over the other, do I need a reason?

"Did that chair seemed easier to sit on despite being in such an awkward corner? Was that chair to your liking young master? Or perhaps, does it simply feel familiar sitting there?"

This room, this seat, it all feels so familiar and yet, nothing comes to mind when I try to remember. My memory feels fuzzy. I look around the room once more trying to take in the details. Were there cups and plates on the coffee table before? How did I not notice this earlier? There appears to be some leftover food on the plate as well. 

"It is as if that has always been your seat, young master. Have you always sat there when playing cards with friends?"

My gaze slowly returned to the small table in front of me and I saw a pile of playing cards scattered all over. I could've sworn the table was empty just moments ago. My head hurts as if trying to recall something important. Something I've forgotten. 

"Here, have a drink young master."

I grabbed the cup and stared at it for a while. What a strange color for a drink to have, but I gulp it down anyway. It tasted like something I haven't had in a really long time. What could it be? It's so familiar. Of course, it's Ribena! The color should've given it away! 

Suddenly, a few plastic cups half filled with Ribena appeared scattered on the table along with a few piles of chocolate coins. Looking around, I saw a painting on the wall by the door and suddenly, there was a TV opposite one of the couch. The floor was actually carpeted and the room was more furnished than I thought. 

"It appears you have remembered something about this room young master. Please, tell me more about what you remembered."

Again, I tried to speak but the words would not leave my lips. I remember now, this is my friend's living room. We used to play cards here every now and then. But why have we stopped? Something happened here in this room that day. What was it?

Everything came flooding back into my mind. The events that occurred that day, the pain that I felt, and the changes that transpired. Everything came back in one fell swoop, and just like that, my life changed drastically back there and then.

To think, that's only about 800 words. I still have about 49,200 words to go and only 15 days left to write it all. The genre is most definitely Mystery, as for the title and story synopsis, I have yet to come up with the full story. Still making this up as I go along, hopefully, it doesn't backfire horribly on me.
