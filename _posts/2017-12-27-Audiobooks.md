title: The wonders of audiobooks
---

A few years ago, a friend introduced to me the idea of audiobooks. He would listen to them while cooking, going for walks, shopping and just in general whenever he could. He says that it's better than reading. At that point in time, I didn't give it much thought and dismissed it right away. Perhaps it's because I like reading too much.

In my mind, there were a few annoying drawbacks to listening, such as the inability to go back to a previous page or reference an earlier chapter easily. Unlike a book, you can't skim through the pages to look for something specific, nor can you skim through the past few pages to remind yourself what you read yesterday.

Fast forward to the past few months, another friend introduced audiobooks to me. She listens to it during her daily commute to work and it helped her finish a couple of books that way. Again, I had the same gut reaction.

There's just no substitute for having a book in front of you. My qualms seem to come from the fear of missing a few words here and there. Yes, I'm a very thorough reader and would hate to mishear a word or sentence. The idea of having to rewind the audio just ruins the entire experience. It's so much easier to read instead.

But when you see patterns such as these, it's no mere coincidence. Most likely, there's a reason why my two friends recommended audiobooks. There has to be something about it that makes them so crazy about it. Despite the downsides I mentioned, there's the obvious advantage of not having to read. Is it really that great an advantage?

Fast forward to the past few weeks, I decided to try it myself. I download some talks and podcasts, put them on my phone and listen to them during my daily commute. My perceived annoyance at the drawbacks? They don't matter anymore, not in the face of the overwhelming advantage of being able to multitask. 

The wonders of listening to an audiobook are that your hands are free to do whatever it wants and you don't have to focus your eyes on a book. You can listen while you drive, while you run, and while doing other mundane activities that don't require much brain power, similar to what my two friends did.

It's amazing how much we're underutilizing my brain sometimes. I managed to finish over 8 hours of audio material in just one week! All because I listened while driving. It's unbelievable, I'm wasting more than 8 hours a week driving, imagine how much I can learn if I spend that time listening to books instead.

The compounding effect is just mindblowing. Suppose I do this for a year, that's more than 400 hours spent listening to books. In one year, imagine how much extra stuff I can learn. Books I wanted to read but didn't have time for, isn't this just the perfect solution?

Heck, I can even optimize it some more. At the moment, I'm listening to the audio materials mostly at 1x speed. To further optimize my time without taxing precious mental resources, I experimented with different speeds and found to 1.5x to be reasonably comfortable to do while driving. Listening at 2x or 2.5x speed is actually doable but not while driving or multitasking as it takes too much concentration. 

There are three points I want to make. The first is to not dismiss something right away without having tried it yourself. Especially if multiple friends are recommending it to you. There's usually a reason why they want you to try it. 

The second is to try listening to audio material. Seriously, they are amazing! Best use of time ever. It's also a good way to finally be able to 'read' a book a week. 

The third point? There is no third point. But if I have to make one up, I'd say not having time is no excuse to not be doing something. Look what I did, I gain 8 hours of extra time per week dedicated to learning something. You just have to know where to look.

I have yet to try with actual audiobooks but my experiment with talks and podcasts so far proved to be very promising. I'm planning to get either a Scribd or an Audible subscription as a source of audiobooks.
