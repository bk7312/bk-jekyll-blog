title: A brand new blog
---

Late January, I went on a three months long hiatus. When I came back late April, I said I was going to try something different very soon. I continued posting weekly until late May, then without warning, I went silent again.

But in reality, I didn't. I simply moved to a different blog, started posting daily and didn't tell you guys about it! Whoops, I forgot to update it here but better late than never! 

Check out my new blog at https://zieltranslation.wordpress.com/

I'll keep this blog as it is, might use it for something else in the future, who knows.
