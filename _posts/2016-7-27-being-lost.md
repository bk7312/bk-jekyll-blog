title: On being lost.
---

I think I'm lost again. In this crowded world filled with contradicting directions, I find myself unsure of which path to follow. Was I even following a path in the first place or was I just going around in circles? Especially with what happened recently, a friend tried to get me to become a salesperson while another introduced me to the world of investments. All in the name of financial freedom. Exciting times to finally be a grown up!

After that sales pitch from one friend, I asked another friend for advice. Turns out, there's a whole world out there I still don't know about. For example, financial planning. So far, my plan is simple. Take X% out of my salary into savings and treat the remaining (100-X)% as my "actual salary". Then, from my "actual salary", I would use as much as I need (occasionally a bit on what I want) and save the rest. The rule is to never spend more than my "actual salary" and save as much as reasonably possible from it. It's a simple rule and yes, I'm a very frugal person.

However, in the world of finance, there's this thing called investments. The idea is to put money somewhere and let it grow bigger and faster, ideally faster than inflation. My investment friend was kind enough to recommend a few books for me and there's one titled "One-page financial plan" which is awesome. The three main lessons I took from that book are:

1. **Know why money is important.** The first step is to actually know why money is important to you. What exactly do you want to do with your money after earning them? How much do you actually need? All interesting questions I haven't thought about. What exactly does financial freedom even mean to me? 

2. **Start guessing, then calibrate and iterate.** No one can predict the future. So guess! Try estimating and correcting yourself if anything goes off. Practice dealing with uncertainty and keep things simple.

3. **No shame, no blame.** This is my favorite! I didn't realize it but I have a habit of blaming and shaming myself for my mistakes, especially tiny ones that don't really matter. For example, impulse buying which I would later regret just to get rid of that 5 cents in my wallet. Or unwittingly buying at the more expensive store. What was I thinking blaming and shaming myself for that? Humans are irrational creatures and no one is perfect, so what's the point in worrying and finger pointing. Just learn from it, shrug off all the emotional baggage and move on.

You've probably noticed that the lessons have nothing to do with investments. Not that there wasn't an investment chapter, there was, just that it wasn't the main lessons. Currently, the only investment I'm making is spending the time to learn stuff. This is where I started feeling lost.

The "why" question. Why am I learning what I'm learning? What makes me tick? What exactly do I want? All very difficult questions indeed. I have yet to come up with a solid enough answer but they all point towards something similar, becoming a more capable and independent person. Who doesn't want that right? I'm really lacking in the specifics, or perhaps I'm unconsciously aware of what I want but don't want to realize or admit it. It's certainly possible.

Everything is left undefined like a big question mark and I would like to spend some quality time pondering this question. My "why" quest-ion. The legendary ion rumored to change lives. The ion served as a guiding star for those lost in the darkness of society. The ion that's often right under our noses but we don't search there because we can't see it.

Why? Stay tuned next week! *If I managed to find out.*
