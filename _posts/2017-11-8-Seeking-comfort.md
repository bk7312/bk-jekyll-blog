title: Seeking comfort
---

With my recent work-related misadventures coming to an end, the inherent exhaustion of going to work early and coming home late has ended. I am yet again hit by the relief of only having to work the normal hours. And so ends my excuse for seeking comfort after a tiring day of work.

I've been slacking off an awful lot the past few weeks, not at work but at home. So many things I've put off, excusing myself for not doing simply because I'm tired. Running away from the discomfort and seeking instead to idle around in bed reading my tablet. 

Of course, it's purely debatable whether a hard day's worth of work justifies a blissful evening where all personal errands get neglected until further notice. But to have a month's worth of such blissful evenings, it can only spell disaster to my personal life, irrespective of how well I do at work, for such is irrelevant here.

A person I look up to once said. The most important time to do something is when you feel the urge not to do it at its strongest. It's easy to do something if you want to do it, the hard part is doing it when you're feeling tired, demotivated and uninspired. A person who knows what has to be done, but doesn't want to do it, but still does it anyway, that's the mark of a true champion. The goal is to train yourself so that the moment you feel like you don't want to do something, you immediately go do it. 

That's very hardcore indeed but I don't have a limitless supply of energy. It certainly does show what I lacked these past few weeks, the resolve to do something despite feeling tired. Not all the time but at least part of the time. There are always those people who thrive on working in the extremes, people with high tolerance to burnouts and resistance to exhaustion. 

But alas, my brain is very good at outsmarting me. Countless times, I've convinced myself to seek comfort instead of pushing through with it. Giving in to my urge, slacking off and enjoying the evening, pointlessly idling around. Sooner or later, I'll realize that the feeling only lasts for a short while. Eventually, everything goes down the drain and I'll regret it the next day only to make the same mistake yet again. 

Exhaustion, a lack of energy, the state of being tired. I know I don't have limitless energy, the issue then becomes an optimization problem in figuring out where to best spend my energy. It doesn't feel like a procrastination problem but it could very well be. The only difference is that the root cause seems to be my energy levels.

Train yourself so that the moment you try to resist doing something becomes the moment you start doing it without thinking.
