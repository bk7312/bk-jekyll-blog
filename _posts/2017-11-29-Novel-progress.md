title: Novel thoughts and progress
---

It's been two weeks since I started writing that novel. It has a proper title and synopsis now. As written previously, the story is about a guy who was brought to an oddly familiar room by someone who kept calling him "Young Master". With no recollection of anything, he struggles to recall what happened. The title is "Locked Memories" which I find rather plain. Most likely, I'll change it as I want the title to be more fitting for the content. 

In the past two weeks, the process I went through to write the novel was rather interesting. On day 1, I started on a whim and managed to write about 800 words which gave the introduction to my story. However, from day 2 onwards, I did not write a single word and it was only just a few days ago that I started writing. Yes, it's called procrastinating. Well, not exactly. Rather, I don't want to write myself into a dead end and having to scrap everything and start over. 

As a result, I spent a considerable amount of time thinking how the story should flow. How will it end? What could've happened that caused the main character in the story to suppressed his memories? How do I explain the room and his dazed mental state? What incident can I come up with that is interesting enough to warrant all that has happened? All these questions I didn't think about when I first wrote the initial 800 words. 

My initial idea was to have the main character recall his childhood and face the past he's been running away from and the mysterious Ziel will be providing hints along the way. The whole story will take place in that mysterious room. But, how do I explain the mysterious Ziel who knows so much about the main character? A name that is coincidentally a word that means something in another language? Most likely, the mysterious room will have to be part of a dream or some supernatural occurrence for this to work. 

After some thought, I quickly abandoned that idea. Instead, I opted to have it in the real world. The main character went into the mysterious room. Dazed with no recollection of what happened before entering, he experiences plenty of flashbacks and finally snaps out of his mental sluggishness and back into reality. Afterwards, he goes around investigating the missing bits and pieces to fill the gaps in his memory. 

Of course, I plan to have Ziel there as well and he will be Sherlock playing the role of Watson while the main character will be Watson trying to be Sherlock. It will be a comical reversal where the assistant is actually sharper than the detective and provides seemingly innocent hints to nudge the detective into the right track to solve the mystery. 

Then I scrap that idea as it felt too difficult. There's the matter of coming up with a good story that allows for that kind of investigation. But alas, I can't come up with a storyline that's interesting and complex enough. My next idea is not actually an idea. One of the main challenges I'm facing is trying to think of a plot with enough twists and turns that will get the readers so engrossed in the story they can't put it down. But perhaps I don't have to! 

This is where I had a mini-revelation. Perhaps I shouldn't focus so much on the actual plot itself but rather, how I the plot is presented. What I've thought of, alternating viewpoints. The idea is to write the story from various different viewpoints and hide certain information from each. That way, the readers will only get the complete picture of what happened after going through the different viewpoints of the individual characters. 

Yes, there's still the matter of making the incidents and flashbacks interesting but I find that creating these viewpoints each with their own limited information creates far more suspense. To take it one step further, I'm scrambling the sequence of events and will be jumping around between the different viewpoints. That way, it will seem like several events are happening in parallel and the reader doesn't know which came first until they read the later chapters where everything comes together in one piece. 

The actual story itself doesn't have to be that interesting if I can make the execution interesting. Yeah, I feel like I'm cheating the system here but hey, art isn't judged by what you paint but how you paint. Which brings me to where I am now. Just a few days ago, I started writing frantically and right now, with two days left on the clock (today and tomorrow), I am still nowhere near the point of even reaching the halfway mark of 25K words. 

I highly doubt I can finish it by the end of the month but it doesn't matter. I'll continue it slowly but surely, I have the outline in my head so I think I'll manage somehow. Most probably, I'll have the first draft ready by the end of the year and I'll see how it goes from there.

I don't know why I didn't think of this alternating viewpoint idea sooner. I've read so many books and seen it being used everywhere, it's only when I was leisurely reading a web novel a few days ago that I realized.
