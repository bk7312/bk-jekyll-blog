title: Overcoming reading addiction
---

Before I knew it, yet another hour ha passed by. And I'm halfway through yet another chapter. This has been happened a lot lately, especially late at night. I would finish a chapter, can't resist reading the next and halfway through the next chapter, I would panic after glancing at the time and promise myself this is the last. It's never the last.

I have unknowingly reawakened my inner reader. An imaginary beast that devours sentence after sentence, paragraph after paragraph, and page after page of whatever catches its eye. 

If you have ever experienced it, you will know just how terrifying a reading addiction can be. And how exhilarating it can feel to be blasting page after page through a good book. 

Sometimes, all it takes is a little nudge. That small nudge where you open a book and read the first sentence. A sentence here, a sentence there and before you knew it, you've already fallen deep down into the rabbit hole.

Sometimes, a reading addiction can really get out of hand. You read and read, the more you read the harder it is to stop. Hours would pass by and you would spend the whole day reading. You don't even want to stop to get food. You started neglecting sleep, preferring to read all night long. You even resist crawling out of bed just to get a glass of water or use the toilet.

Soon, days passed by and you realized just how unproductive you've been. All you did was read all day long. Your personal life is starting to fall apart. You've neglected your errands, stopped taking care of yourself, and perhaps started feeling guilty about it. 

That is reading addiction at its worst. It's also a sign that your mind is no longer in the real world. The good news is, most people won't even come close to experiencing such drastic symptoms. But if you ever feel that addicted to reading, how do you stop it? You can't just stop reading, it doesn't work that way. It wouldn't be an addiction if it was that easy. 

For me personally, I developed this addiction from wanting to know what happens next. This desire to know, it consumed me and turned me into such an addict. I would read so much voraciously that it consumed most of my time.

The end result? I feel like I've wasted hours neglecting my personal life, reading instead of being productive. Letting my errands, workouts, personal studies and hobbies all slide. It also feels like I'm not appreciating the book for what it is anymore. 

Strangely enough, the solution I found was to simply slow down and appreciate the book more. It might sound counterintuitive, I mean, I'll end up spending more time reading right? Not exactly. 

The problem I had was over-reading and wasting an inordinate amount of time because I can't stop. Slowing down solves it perfectly. Instead of blasting through the words, I read them deliberately and try to grasp more of what the author is intending. This makes it easier to stop and also enriches the reading experience. 

Sometimes, you can actually get more of what the author is trying to convey from the choice of words used. It's rather hard to explain but try it yourself. Read slower and soon, you'll find that there's a lot more depth to the characters and the story. 

Some authors really like sprinkling a bit of symbolism, explore a few themes or ideas, and include some hidden patterns here and there. It's much more fun uncovering those than blindly reading to find out what happens next.

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, try active reading instead. It's a lot more practical and easier to do, works better for non-fiction though. Simply read and summarize what happened, do it actively while reading. It'll create enough friction to stop the addiction and your efforts will be rewarded with a better understanding of the material.

I don't think a lot of people appreciate reading these days. It's a bit like eating, there are those who eat to feel full, and there are those who eat to enjoy the food.  Those who take the time to chew and properly taste the food are rare, and they're just about as rare as those who take the time to read and properly appreciate how well the book was crafted.

This all happened a couple of weeks ago when I was still drafting my novel. I stopped to read a few novels just to get some ideas and the rest is history.
