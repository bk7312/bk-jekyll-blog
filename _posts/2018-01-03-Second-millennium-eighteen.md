title: The second millennium just turned eighteen
---

The title was inspired by a comic I read a couple of days ago. It's 2018, meaning the second millennium, the year 2000, just turned 18, thus 2018. Get it? Tumbleweeds eh. So be it.

I actually don't have much to write for this week's entry. It seems like the pressure of wanting to put out an awesome post to begin the new year has really gotten to me. I ended up procrastinating instead. 

Nevertheless, I shall keep my word! The worst thing you can do is to fail at your promises during the first week of the year. Yup, there's very little you could do that's worse than that, in terms of setting and achieving goals and resolutions that is.

With that out of the way, what are your plans for 2018? Surely there has to be something good to look forward to. As for me, I have a couple of big plans which I'll keep to myself for now. Not that it matters anyway, I'll reveal it soon enough if anyone cares to find out. Hopefully, I can get it going before the end of March.

They say that eighteen is the sign of adulthood. Depending on where you live and your jurisdiction, there are many things you can legally do once you reached eighteen. You can legally drive, legally consume alcohol and legally do all those grown-up activities like owning property, paying bills, do things without parental consent and whatnot. 

Whatever grown-ups legally do, you can do it legally once you legally reached eighteen. Legally. You will be legal upon reaching eighteen. Unless you're regal. In which case, you are regal regardless of age and can "regally" do pretty much anything you want. Regally. Life is good when you're regal, that's the difference between the L's and the R's. 

So when our baby millennium turned eighteen, guess what's gonna happen? The possibilities are endless. Our baby millennium is all grown up now and has just started on its journey as a fine adult just two days ago after all the fireworks. 

You can't possibly stay still after hearing that, don't you feel any sense of progress? Perhaps it's a sense of achievement after seeing such growth, or maybe a sense of getting old. What are you going to do about it? Time waits for no one. Whatever you do, time is going to pass anyway, regardless. 

The millennium reaching eighteen is one such proof of it. Before you know it, the millennium will reach twenty-one. Not long after, it will be in its early 30s. Soon, our baby millennium will be in its 40s, 50s, and 60s as a grumpy old millennium. Then, it will retire and eventually die of old age. At that point, a new millennium will be born. Yes, the glorious third millennium, Year 3000!

Such is what makes life precious. So let me ask again, what are you going to do this year? Don't just let your time go to waste, it will waste itself if you do nothing. So start now, make this year the start of your adulthood and take responsibility for your life.

Honestly, I was not expecting to write this but the idea was just too amusing to pass. So much for writing about my goals.
