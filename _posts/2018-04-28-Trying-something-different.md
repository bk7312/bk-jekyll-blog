title: Trying something different
---

Hello there, it's been a while. I'm back from my three-month hiatus and I'll be trying something different starting today. I can't tell you what it is yet, but I'm planning on changing a few things about the way I write, and perhaps the stuff I write as well. 

So much happened in the past three months, and it all started with that rather unexpected trip I took. Following that, my phone finally broke and I now have a new. To think that not long ago, I was so opinionated about small phones, I still am to some extent, but my mindset has changed a little. The essence of my opinion stayed the same but I learned that it isn't worth fussing over it. It isn't important enough to warrant pouring so much time and energy into it.

Another thing that happened was that I met up with someone, someone who is a specialist, a trained professional, and a consultant. This happened right before starting my not so grueling three weeks worth of night assignments. During my assignment, I even had the pleasure of working with another person, one worthy of being a specialist, a professional in training, and a consultant. While it has only been a few weeks since I last saw them, it felt like the encounter was something from the distant past. So many questions yet to be answered, my mind is still swirling with uncertainty as I think back to what is and what is to come.

Shortly after my night assignment, two more assignments came coming my way. It was around that time that I started reading again, and it was also around that time that I chanced upon a certain blog post. Little did I know, I became obsessed with that post. It was a really long article, one that took me about two hours to finish. Yes, about two hours, longer if I include the time spent reading the reference materials. It led me to really stop and think, it also prompted me to read a few other two-hour articles, from the same author, that I've been procrastinating on. 

Which brings us back to today, I have a few new things I'd like to try. Not all will be published here, some will be done elsewhere just so I can better manage things. I will decide which one goes where but something will definitely change about this place.
