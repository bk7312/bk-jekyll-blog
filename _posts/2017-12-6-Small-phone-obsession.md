title: My small phone obsession
---

Ever since my phone's touchscreen went faulty, I've been obsessed with which new phone to get as a replacement. Obsessed to the point that it was all I think about, which was definitely not healthy. You could say, I developed a small phone obsession (no pun intended).

Brief history, I got my first phone back in 2012 as a gift before leaving for university. It lasted a full three years before it started having overheating and signal problems. That was around graduation and shortly before starting my job as a graduate engineer, I got a new phone of about the same size. It lasted a full two years before developing touchscreen problems and here I am. 

Up until now, I never really gave much thought to phones. I mean, why would I worry so much about something I already have and not planning to buy? Well, that all changed when my touchscreen started acting up. It was then that I first dived into the world of phones, and I sank. I sank ever so deeply. 

I thought it would be simple to just look up a good phone that meets what I want and buy it, but the world of phones has changed. The more phones I read about, the deeper I sank. It got to the point where I would stay up late just to research more. It was getting ridiculous! 

The reason I was reading up so much about phones is probably not what you think. See, I had this one simple requirement I want to meet. Three actually, but there's this one requirement that most phones just can't seem to meet. 

See, the problem is that 5" phones are now considered the norm, or even small. I don't understand. It's unbelievably hard to find good phones in the 4" to 4.5" range. There are a few but they're so rare, they're almost like an endangered species now. 

It seems like not many people like small phones anymore, most of the people I know, and those online who I don't, prefer those big phones with huge screens and gorgeous displays for all their viewing pleasures. 

Does no one appreciate the elegance of a small phone anymore? The way it fits in your hand, the ease in holding it, and how easy it just slips in your pocket? 

Granted, the screen is what you use your phone for 99% of the time nowadays. No one ever calls anymore so they might as well remove that function and save on cost or something. These days, phones are for playing games, watching videos and using social media. 

With the recent advances in screen technology and battery life, your phone is now the most attractive thing to spend all your time on. Before we knew it, the lure of your phone is stronger and more distracting than ever. And that's exactly the point of having an awesome screen! 

I don't want that, I'd trade all that away in exchange for portability and ease of one-handed use. I don't want my phone to be such a huge part of my life (pun intended). Ironic how I'm making such a huge fuss about it though. 

I am definitely part of the minority who frowns upon the yearly growth in phone sizes. Whether it is our inability to adapt to the current trend or the rarity in our type of thinking and reasoning, I can only hope that this is not the end.

In case you're wondering, I simply replaced the touchscreen and that's about it. The phone is hopefully good for a few more years before I need to find a replacement.
