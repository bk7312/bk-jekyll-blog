A while back, I saw someone clipping their nails in the office. I know, it's probably not that rare a sight to see. Everyone has nails right? Just gotta clip them, all for the sake of having good personal hygiene and avoiding disastrous nail-related injuries. It's a good idea to trim your nails often, even if it means doing it in the office during working hours. Of course!

The interesting thing about him is that before he even started clipping his nails, he took two pieces of tape and taped both sides of the nail cutter. As I saw him do this, I thought to myself. That guy's a genius! Why didn't I thought of it? By sticking tape down both sides of the nail cutter, you essentially eliminate the possibility of having nails fly all over the place as you clip them. What a brilliant idea indeed! 

But after a while, I started imagining how he could've thought of that idea. Perhaps after so many years of nail clipping, he finally got tired of finding nail bits everywhere and having to clean up after himself that he deliberately looked for ways to prevent the bits from scattering randomly? Or perhaps while clipping his nails one day, he saw someone using tape to hold lots of small nuts and bolts as to not accidentally drop or lose them, and then made the connection to taping the sides of his nail clipper. It is also entirely possible that he saw someone doing it or simply read about it somewhere, but that would be very disappointing. 

In this day and age, it doesn't really matter who first discovered or invented what. There exist too many tips and tricks that one cannot simply keep track of who first discovered it. There's also no point to it. Take ice-cream, for example, the idea of freezing some form of fluid, be it milk or cream, and eating it. The idea is probably not that hard to come up with and multiple countries have probably come up with the idea independent of each other. But who is the first? No one really knows, but does it matter? 

What matters is not who first discovered it. Instead, what matters is whether or not someone discovered something independently by themselves. The world is huge, there are bound to be repeated discoveries of the same things. What's amazing are the people who managed to discover, or even rediscover something entirely on their own. 

Suppose a random kid who has never heard of the idea called 'gravity', and that kid suddenly had a thought. "How come things that go up always come down? Why don't they stay up?" With a bit more effort, that kid might just independently discover the concept of gravity. How cool would that be? Everyone else would just be told that there's this thing called 'gravity' and that's the reason why we can't fly, or something along those lines. 

I suppose my point is, a lot of things are already discovered and if you look hard enough online, you can find pretty much the solution to any problem. But is that a good thing? Being fed answers doesn't do much to help our creative thinking and instead dulls our mind. Try to explore more, discover things yourself and experience the hidden delights in the journey of discovery.

I still can't believe someone was casually clipping their nails in the office during working hours.
