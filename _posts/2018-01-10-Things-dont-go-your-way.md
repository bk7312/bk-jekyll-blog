title: What to do when things don't go your way
---

I woke up to the sound of my alarm this morning but couldn't get myself to stay up. It's the third day in a row this happened. Lately, a lot of things aren't going my way and it's been very depressing. It was only this evening, I noticed something that made me feel a lot better. 

Disclaimer: In a way, what I'm about to say might feel like I'm just throwing money at my problems but that's not true. 

These past few nights, I couldn't get any decent sleep at all. I had a lot going on at work, which made it difficult to sleep. That, in turn, makes it hard to deal with work the next day, which then makes it hard for me to sleep that night because of what happened during the day. 

It's a self-reinforcing negative spiral that gets harder and harder to escape. It's also not helping that I'm in the middle of creating a wake-up-early-every-day habit. It's only week three and this had to happen. 

So this morning, instead of waking up and reading the morning paper like I planned, I ended up reading comics instead. At least I didn't go back to bed but this is the second time I skipped the morning paper. I feel like if this keeps up, the morning routine I'm trying to create might end up in shambles. 

This isn't going to work. My brain feels sluggish and the best I could do was mindlessly consume comics. Wouldn't it be better to go back to bed? No, there's a high chance it might break my habit and I'd end up waking late again.

The solution? Solve the frustrations at work, that'll stop me from not having a good night's sleep. But how? It's not a simple problem that I can just tell it to go away or fix it in a blink of an eye. It was only tonight that I noticed, there's an alternative way to solving this issue.

My mind was too focused on the things that didn't go my way. The excessive work that I couldn't handle, the annoying tasks I didn't want to do, and the queries I couldn't answer. There was a strong sense of helplessness. 

You might think I tackled the issue by asking for help or trying to push through it with sheer grit. But no, I can't go crying for help every time I'm stuck and I'm not that strong mentally as to be able to power through it. My approach is a lot softer.

This afternoon, I had lunch with a few friends at work. Those who I haven't talked to in quite a while. Since it was quite a rare occasion, I ordered drinks instead of getting plain water like I usually do. I also upgraded my meal with the fried rice add-on instead of the usual plain rice. 

Sure I splurged a little but it made me feel better, especially considering what my mental state was at work. It made my afternoon a lot more pleasant. 

During lunch, one of my friends mentioned something about the hidden 4th floor in a plaza near where I stay. Intrigued, I went to check it out after work. Honestly, I've been to that plaza a couple of times already but never really noticed it. 

Apparently, there's a hidden stairway that leads to another section of the building. Getting there felt very sketchy but arriving there I saw a gym, a boxing and Muay Thai studio, a small spinning studio, and a Zumba place. It's like a mini fitness getaway! Plus a few offices and service shops. 

On the way out, I stumbled upon a small outdoors shop and went in. There's quite a nice selection of cool toys including flashlights, survival gear, bags, outdoor clothes and so on. While I wasn't planning on getting anything, I ended up buying something just for the heck of it, after careful consideration of course. I hardly buy on impulse.

The pattern I noticed was this, when I try to get myself to do something hard, be it waking up early, dealing with frustration at work, or just getting myself to do things I don't want to, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of discomforts. Doing so repeatedly wears me down a lot and makes me feel like crap sometimes.

On the other hand, getting myself a fancier meal during lunch or buying myself a high-quality outdoor gear made me felt like I'm rewarding myself. Or rather, by treating myself to something, I feel like my efforts are being acknowledged, that I deserved it. That gave me the strength to carry on and push further.

When was the last time you treated yourself to something nice? If you're feeling cranky and frustrated, it might be worth treating yourself. Give yourself a break, acknowledge the hardships you're going through and give yourself some space to stop and breath.
