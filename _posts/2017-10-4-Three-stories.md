title: The three stories
---

I have three stories I want to share today, each with their own quirks. The first is the delightful story of a faithful dog who left for a journey in place of his injured master. Unfortunately, the dog doesn't know the scent of his destination so he can't sniff his way there. Thus, he has to rely on the goodwill of the people along the road to reach his destination. 

The second story is about a guy who left home in pursuit of his dreams but ten years have passed and he is still struggling to get by. One day, he found out that his father was hospitalized and decides to return home and continue the family business. However, instead of taking over the family business, he is instead asked to be a fatherly figure to a girl who everyone calls the successor. 

The last story is something I really don't want to talk about. Not because the plot is uninteresting, but rather, I'm not a big fan of the content. The description says that it is the tale of a New York police officer who lands one-night stands every night, but then one day, he met his soulmate. It also claims that it is an ambitious piece of work that portraits true love and humanism.

Judging by the theme of the story, you would think that the plot is going to be amazing. I certainly did, until I read the actual content. No, it's not that the contents were bad, it's just that I find the part about his soulmate really hard to swallow. Why? He's a guy. Those one-night stands? Yup, those as well. It really is an ambitious piece of work, a bit too ambitious perhaps. The current me can't swallow it very well so this is all you'll ever hear from me about it. 

So there are actually only two stories I want to share. The dog's journey and the guy who couldn't take over his family's business. Personally, I prefer the latter as the main challenge in that story is the dialects used. For the former, the challenge lies in the historical and cultural context of the journey itself. See, these are the three stories up for translation and I can't quite decide which to pick. Which one is harder? Translating and preserving the use of different dialects? Or translating and adapting contexts from one culture to another, potentially having to explain the concepts from scratch?

Personally, I would very much prefer to translate dialects over dissecting a culture and trying to figure out how to best explain the underlying common knowledge to an audience unfamiliar with it, without bogging everything down with explanations. However, translating dialects isn't easy either. It's one thing to know how to speak and understand a certain dialect, but what do you translate it into? How do you preserve the quirks of a dialect when translating it? These are two very difficult questions indeed. 

A common way of tackling dialects is to translate them into regional accents. Depending on the context and the characters, it might be more appropriate to either give them a posh British accent, or a rowdy Texas accent. However, there is a limit to this. Namely, you have to have some fluency over the accents you're translating into. Otherwise, it can end up pretty badly. Here lies my problem, I want to learn dialects but to translate them as well? That means I might also have to adopt an accent to learn.

The judges actually gave a tip for translating dialects. They recommend looking for qualities attributed to speakers of certain dialects and reflecting that in their word choice. It sounds simple enough but the devil is in the details. That means I have to really work at reading the characters and dissecting their dialects, and somehow find a fitting way to represent their qualities in how they say things. Sounds tough. Perhaps it's not that different from adapting cultural context, after all, they both have their challenges. 

Oh yeah, I still haven't share anything about the two stories yet. Stay tuned next week, I'll put up a post for one of the two stories. It won't be a translation or anything like that, just a summary that describes the main plot in my own words. Maybe a few comments here and there as well. Basically, a rewrite of the story.

From the three stories I've just described, you can actually look up the exact competition I'll be entering. Considering my current level, the chances winning are actually really slim. That said, even if it's just 0.01%, it still beats having 0% if I didn't enter. Besides, I don't have anything to lose but everything to gain.
