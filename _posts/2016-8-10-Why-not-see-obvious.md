title: Why do we not see the obvious?
---

Back to the question of why. Why do I do what I do, what makes me tick? Why do I not know the answer to that question? Is it not supposed to be obvious? Shouldn't I be the one to know myself best? Or is it precisely because it's obvious that I don't see it? To put this into perspective, consider the difficulty in seeing what's right under your nose. 

Nigh impossible. Don't you find it fascinating? Something that's so close to you, yet you can't see it. It's right under your nose! How can you not be aware of it? Because it's a blind spot. Similarly, we often don't see the obvious hidden in plain sight because it's a blind spot.

To see what's under our nose, we would either have to turn our nose invisible or somehow move our nose out of the way. Or, we could use a mirror. Only then can we see that small vertical groove between our nose and lips, or philtrum for those interested in nasal anatomy. 

Using the nose analogy, consider how I can't answer my "why" question. Note that my assumption is that the answer should be obvious. 

How do I know myself? I have access to all my thoughts, able to know what I'm doing at all times both publicly or privately and have a full history of everything that has happened to me so far. From that, I should know myself best and know everything there is to know about myself since I have the full complete set of data. Then why do I still miss the obvious? How is it that other people are more capable of seeing all the little obvious things about me that I'm not aware of?

It's because I can't see what's under my nose but other people can. But how do they relate to each other? What's the "nose" in this situation? Thoughts. Other people mostly see our actions (philtrum) while we mostly see our thoughts (nose). Let me explain, there's this very interesting relationship between our thoughts and our actions. 

I'm sure you're already aware but our thoughts and actions don't always align. Take the classic example of procrastination, we often thought of doing something but never really doing it. Not all our thoughts turn into actions, but the reverse is different. Consider the act of dwelling too much on the past, we kept having thoughts or revisiting something we already did in the past. Conversely, most of our actions turn into thoughts about them. From this, we can learn three things.

The first, the reason we don't always see the obvious about ourselves is that we have too many thoughts in our mind that never turns into action. Those thoughts are clouding our mind and thus, we don't see the obvious, just like we don't see our philtrum. On the other hand, other people only see our actions and can thus more clearly see the obvious. 

Second, since our actions turn into thoughts a lot more easily than the reverse, we can use this to our advantage by faking it till we make it. Think you're lazy? Try recalling the times you worked hard. Don't have any? Work hard today, then recall it tomorrow. Soon, you'll see yourself in a different light and attribute yourself as a hard worker.

Last but not least, the actions we take is a great source of information about ourselves. Why don't all our thoughts turn into actions? Because our thoughts generally have a horrible signal-to-noise ratio. Most of our thoughts are noise and don't really contribute to anything meaningful. The signals we generate are few and far between. From our actions, it also becomes a lot easier to tell if something is the signal or the noise. However, we rarely truly notice our actions in the present moment. Most of the time, our mind is drifting somewhere in the sea of thoughts and hence, we miss things.

If we could have a detached part of ourselves view us objectively from a third-person point of view at all times, without access to any of our noisy thoughts, I believe that detached self will be able to paint the most accurate picture of who we are and how we work. Simply for reasons we ourselves can't help but be distracted by our thoughts.

The questions that remain unanswered will eventually be answered. Actions speak louder than words, don't forget that.
