title: A sales pitch from a close friend.
---

Recently, a close friend of mine gave me a sales pitch. He was trying to convince me to try a product he was distributing, and maybe, just maybe, I could start helping him distribute as well. Gut reaction, not so good. However, I find my mind disagreeing with my gut. Not that I'm buying what he's trying to get me to do but my mind is having a different thought altogether. Fair warning, this is post has about 2000 words.

If there's one useful skill I learned in school, it's critical thinking and boy did I use it a lot that day. My mind subconsciously started deconstructing his sales pitch the moment my gut told me to stay far far away from it. The situation also turned somewhat delicate, my friend is trying to sell me something, how do I politely say no? After all, money-related matters can easily destroy a relationship if not handled properly.

Now where do I begin? 

### How the pitch started

To be honest, I don't exactly know when all this started. Occasionally, my friend would subtly hint about it but that might just be my imagination. Knowing how skeptical I am of things, maybe he didn't know how to give me his sales pitch without being seen as one of those stereotypical salesmen. Perhaps he slowly built it up so it wouldn't feel like he was giving his pitch out of nowhere. 

That day, I got curious about the drink he keeps drinking every time after we had our run and so I asked. 

"What's that you keep drinking after every run, powdered chocolate milk?"

Turns out, it's chocolate-flavored protein. Close enough, then the topic turned into health and that's how the dominoes started falling.

Half a decade ago, I would scream and run as far as I could when someone tries to sell me something. I had this idea that they were out to get me and won't leave me alone until I buy what they were selling. Being timid certainly didn't help. 

Fast forward to today and my thinking has changed considerably. Instead of wanting to run away, I find myself drawn to the art of giving a sales pitch. Think about it, the ability to convince someone to listen to you and get them to buy into what you're saying, or selling, *without being seen as annoying and making them hate you*. 

The last point is especially important. To be able to get people's attention, keep them engaged and interested enough to do what you want them to do. How about that? Sales pitches are everywhere, everything you read can be considered as one. Yes, even this post! I'm trying hard to get you to read what I'm writing in the hopes that you'll keep reading what I write. Consider it as paying your time and attention in exchange for whatever values I'm offering in my writing.

### What the pitch was about

This is where my mind went full critical thinking mode. No offense to anyone but critical thinking can be a bit cold and heartless at times. However, it does give a more objective view of the situation so here goes.

The topic shifted from drinking protein to having a healthy breakfast and I was introduced to their range of healthy breakfast options. Yup, it reeks of bias and vested interest. To be fair, the products he was promoting is actually legit and seems to be reasonable. The brand was good, lots of independent reviews gave the product good ratings and so on. No issues with the product and honestly, they were great products, if you're the target audience. The argument he used? 

"Most people either skipped breakfast or don't eat a healthy breakfast. As we all know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day having a healthy and nutritious breakfast is a must. Take the typical breakfast, it has X amount of carbs/fats and Y amount of protein/nutrients/etc. Compare that to our breakfast products which contain..."

Of course, I paraphrased it slightly. Add a strawman argument on why some people can't seem to lose weight and a few about healthy living and that wraps up the first part of his pitch rather nicely.

Now I could go on and argue against some of his points about breakfast, nutrition and healthy living but that would be going off on a tangent. Instead, I would like to point out that I don't think I'm their target audience. **This was lesson number one for me. If the person you're pitching to isn't the target audience then better luck elsewhere.** If I was his target audience, I should find myself agreeing with all or most of what he says and gladly go for it. But that's not the case. Instead, I find myself disagreeing and wanting to challenge a few of his line of thinking. It will be very hard to sell to someone like that so better luck elsewhere.

### What the pitch was really about

His pitch was two-folds, trying to sell the products and trying to convince me to also start selling the product. The second part sounds really dubious at first but then he showed me the maths behind it. Basically, their whole system ran on points. Every time he sold something, he gets a few points and so does the guy who convinced him to sell. By convincing people to sell, he gets points from sales made by the people he convinced to sell. Obviously, more points mean more money and that's their marketing strategy in a nutshell. 

Once a certain point level is reached, that person becomes "independent" and gets cut-off. For each "independent" person he creates, he will supposedly get a fixed income per month for life. The idea is to create lots of "independent" people, and probably becoming "independent" in the process, hence getting a larger fixed income every month without having to do anything for life. 

While their whole marketing strategy seems fishy, the maths behind it seems to work. In my explanation, I probably missed a couple of stuff but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, such as the question of where all that money comes from. So ignoring whether it's a legit marketing strategy or one of those pyramid schemes, it does seem like a viable way to make a living. He even gave examples of a few friends who managed to do it. The hard part is the whole convincing-others-to-sell-for-you part and even that, they have a solution.

Their concept is simple, instead of selling the product the stereotypical way and potentially scaring everyone away and making them hate you, the idea is for the seller to actually use the product and promote them. It's like how someone would use a certain brand and tell all their friends how awesome that brand is. Except, it's the other way around in this case. He joins the marketing organization and tries to convince himself that the brand is awesome, then sells it. That's the opposite of how genuine reviewers work. They review a ton of different products and based on their experience, recommend something they really like that meets most or all of their expectations.

**Here lies lesson number two. The organization framed the problem so instead of trying to sell their products, they share their products.** That way, they can prevent the common mistake sellers make where they end up scaring potential customers by trying to sell too hard. It's a step in the right direction in improving sales but it does feel a bit like they're trying to brainwash their sellers.

My guess is that the organization is trying to leverage seller's enthusiasm and use that as a means to sell. It also has the added bonus that if the enthusiasm spreads, convincing others to start selling also becomes a lot easier. Throw in the promise of compensation and it goes surprisingly well with their recruitment loop. In a sense, they're creating a community around their products, even if they all have a shared vested interest to be in the community.

As for the actual products, the question of how good they really are becomes less important when there's already a community of salespeople ready to use the product and promote them. It really makes me wonder where all this money comes from and how it really flows within the organization.

### Why I should join

In the second part of his pitch, the main technique used here is the typical "hate your job?" argument. Again, I've paraphrased it.

"Why work so hard for a job you hate? Considering that you'll have to work hard for so long until retirement, why not join us and work your butts off for only a few years? Once you've convinced a substantial amount of people to join, you basically get free income for life! Think of it as something like making royalties from books or CD sales. Create something and that something generates your income for life."

Now I like the idea of having a free income for life as much as the next guy, but I just don't see myself wanting to join. Sure, instead of having to work hard for a job I hate for 30 years, I get to work hard for a job I hate fo 3 years and live off the fixed income. Yeah, it shortens the time till financial freedom by a lot. But I still don't see myself joining.

It's not the hard work involved or anything, it's more of the way their business is centered. What exactly will I be doing? Selling and convincing others to sell? No thanks, I'd rather do something else. 

**This is lesson number three, the main lesson I learned that day. If you ever start doubting what you believe or lose sight of what's important, a simple way to reorientate yourself is to try and accept an alternative lesser reality.** 

Here's my current reality, I'm working a demanding job as a junior engineer in the energy industry. Depending on what's going on, I would either find my job satisfying and challenging, or I would be frustrated all day and dread the time I have to stay until I can go home. In my free time, I'm exploring and learning about things as I don't exactly know what I want to do with my life yet. Yes, financial freedom is one of them and no, you can't just give random suggestions on what you think I should or would want to do.

Hearing that sales pitch from my friend, however, allowed me to have a clearer sense of what I want. It might be a bit cliche to say this but I don't want to just achieve financial freedom. I want to actually do something with my life. Something impactful, something that provides others with value and something that would let me say: "I'm not here to just die someday. I'm here to actually make an impact with something."

### Response to his pitch

I have a hard time saying "no" to my friend. Instead, I might have made a worse response by simply stating uncertainty. I know my answer will ultimately be "no" but my mind is telling me something else. It's telling me to actually use this opportunity as a learning experience. Think of all the wonderful knowledge I could gain from sales and marketing, not to mention the experience of doing so. The insights I have gained from pondering about this pitch alone is enormous!

I should be thankful for his pitch. If it was given to me by some random other friend or stranger, I'd probably say "no" straight to their face and doubt I'll be able to learn this much from it.

The conclusion to all this? You're free to draw your own. Let's just say I have a habit of getting side-tracked and thinking about the other finer details instead of the main topic. A friend tries to convince me to do something, I discovered something else about myself. Lastly, thanks for reading, or at least scrolling, all the way till the end.
