title: The destructive powers of being sick.
---

Recently, I fell victim to a number of symptoms. My head was hurting, my eyes dry and in pain, had a fever, stomach was feeling upset and making too much gas, had dry mouth and things tasted bland in my mouth, couldn't sleep very well at night despite feeling tired throughout the day, and so on. The good news is, I'm fine now. Touchwood. 

I'm going to ignore how I got sick because there's just too many factors involved. I was in a room with some 50 other mostly strangers for a few days, I might have eaten something bad, might not have had enough water, might have strained my eyes staring at the board too far away, might have been the hot weather, might have been that weird bug bite on my left elbow, might be related to my recent mental exertion and hence exhaustion, and so on.

What I found out, and this shouldn't come as a surprise really (hindsight bias), is that being sick destroys pretty much everything. Both mentally and physically. My thinking slows down and I became mentally sluggish. Physically, I became weaker and easily tired throughout the day. Even sleep is difficult with a fever. Habits broke down and things I've planned to do gets pushed back. Being sick truly is destructive. 

It's been a while since I've gotten sick like this. Sometimes, I even forget that I can get sick. Also, I find it very strange that I never planned for sickness. Sure I've planned some contingency here and there, for what to do when things go wrong, but the one assumption I've always had was that I would still be in the condition to continue. Say if something went wrong, what will I do and what would be my backup? That kind of thinking, I assumed that I would always be able to do the backup action. But what if I was out instead? If something goes wrong and I'm unable to do anything, like being sick, what can I do aside from letting things get pushed back? I've never planned for that before.

It never occurred to me that I could be out, for an unspecified period of time, being sick. I really do wonder why it never occurred to me. Was it because being sick was such a rare thing? Or was it because I assumed that I would only get mildly sick and that wouldn't affect anything? Perhaps the very idea of planning for sickness implies that I'm planning to get sick. It's very different from planning for leaves and vacations. Should sickness even be planned for? Or, should it be left as something unexpected, never to be considered until one actually falls sick?

Put it another way, do you ever plan for sickness? Say statistically, there will be X days per year where you'll get sick and you actually planned for it? Or does it just unexpectedly hit you one day and destroys everything?
