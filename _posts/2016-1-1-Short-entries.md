I realized that a few of my recent posts have been a bit wordy? They're not that long, probably about 700 to 1000 words. In fact, they're considered to be more on the short side by some people. What I mean by 'wordy' is not the actual word count itself, I mean the inefficient use of words to get my point accross. Perhaps you don't think that but I feel that my writing can sometimes get a bit too 'chatty' and not to the point. Either I'm setting the bar too high up, or I need to work on my 'information delivery', as I prefer to call it.

It's not just writing, I really want to learn how to be clearer and more to the point in conversations. Like when explaining or presenting something to someone, it feels like I can never get my thoughts straight. Sometimes after I'm done, I even ask myself what exactly was I trying to say back then. It's all jumbled up and the point I'm trying to make just fades into the background, burried by all those other less important details in the conversation.

My solution to this problem? I'm still working on it. Basically, the plan is to simplify things and make my points short and sweet. And simple, but not any simpler. Expect shorter easier to read posts in the coming future! Perhaps I'll even up the posting frequency a bit. But then again, I'm also quite fond of long detailed posts that have a lot of thoughts put into it. We'll see, but I'm definitely making an effort to simplify things.
