title: Digging wells
---

I once read an analogy about digging wells, it's a job no one wants to do. You're literally trying to move dirt from below ground to above ground, it's a dirty job no one appreciates. Everyone wants a well, but no one is willing to put the effort to dig one out. Why? Because as you can imagine, digging wells isn't a very fun activity. Note: The assumption here is that the well is dug by hand with a shovel, not modern power tools, and only by one person.

Just imagine trying to dig a deep hole. Digging a meter deep hole would be easy, you just have to move that amount of dirt out from the ground and put it elsewhere above ground. The hard part comes when you have to dig a few meters. When the depth of the well exceeds your height, what happens then? You still gotta carry all that soil from below ground, to above ground. With a traditional dug well, you might want to go about 10 meters deep depending on location. Imagine how much work it takes to move dirt up by 10 meters.

Knowing the weight of the soil, the probability of encountering and having to dig through hard rocks along the way, and having to find a way to actually move the dirt up that vertical distance, it's not something someone would want to do by themselves with just a shovel. But it certainly is possible, it just takes a lot of time, effort, and patience. After having that giant hole in the ground, the next step is to actually turn it into a well, which I won't go into. The point I want to illustrate is the difficulty of step one, digging the hole. 

Let's just imagine someone trying to dig wells after wells, for whatever reasons. Sooner or later, that someone is gonna get exhausted and progress is gonna slow down considerably. In the beginning, that person might be filled with energy and move at an impressive pace of one well per week. But sooner or later, that person is gonna realized that digging wells ain't fun. It's a lot of effort and people ain't giving enough thanks for it. 

Maybe you can imagine some of the people using the wells. They see a newly dug well and starts using it without paying any attention to who dug it. They just took it for granted and used it. This is generally the case for most things, do you even know who invented toothpaste? Ice cream? Screwdrivers? Bridges? Bread? All these millions and millions of things created by some unknown person, we benefitted so much from them and not a word of thanks, gratitude or acknowledgment. 

Now imagine if those people started getting complacent and demanded wells to be made faster. Just when the digger slows down to take a break as he's getting tired of digging. When the usual one-week per well turned into one month per well, the people might start screaming at the digger to dig faster. Thus begins the vicious cycle that destroys the digger and causes the digger to give up digging.

The idea I was trying to express was this: The only thing worse than digging a well by hand is having someone scream at you to dig faster when you're digging a well by hand. I've heard this analogy being used when people are trying to illustrate how much effort it goes into creating content for free on the internet and yet readers still complain when things are slow to release or not meeting the scheduled releases. Unfortunately, I've somewhat drifted away from my original objective. It doesn't help that I have a cold these past few days.
