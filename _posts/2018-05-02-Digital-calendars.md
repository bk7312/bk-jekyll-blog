title: How come I never realize how useful a calendar app is?
---

It hit me hard when I realized it. I've never properly used any calendar apps before, except at work, where everyone is forced to use it for scheduling meetings and stuff. It's weird but throughout my life, the idea of utilizing a digital calendar* never really crossed my mind. 

* I'm not sure what to call it, digital calendars? Calendar apps? Calendar software? Calendar programs? They all sound somewhat off for some reason. Personally, digital calendar best fits the context so that's what I'll be calling them. 

No, it's not that I've never used a calendar before. It's just that all the calendars I've ever used are paper calendars. Thinking back, they were rather useful tools, so why didn't I transition to using digital calendars? I didn't realize the answer until I asked myself, and what an obvious answer it is.

The first thing that comes to mind is that I don't use it much. My calendar is empty most of the time and I don't schedule much with it. The only thing I ever put on my physical calendar are friend's birthdays, important dates, some random deadlines and that's it. To make matters worse, most of the time, I don't even need the calendar to remind me, I remembered it without checking my calendar! Why? Because there's not that many to remember and they're important enough that I don't forget.

Another reason is my negative association with using digital calendars. The first time I used a digital calendar was when I joined the workforce. This shiny new calendar was integrated into our emails, and it was mainly used for scheduling meetings and whatnot. The problem? No one took the calendar seriously. Hardly anyone responded to any invitations and sometimes, people even ignore the scheduled meetings. 

The naive me back then really took offense from it. I recall one time, my supervisor back then asked me to help schedule a meeting to discuss something, I checked everyone's calendar and chose a free spot, sent the meeting invite and boom, no response, except for my supervisor. A few days later, less than half the people showed up, and most of them showed up late. I had to run around, find the rest of them and drag them to the meeting room. 

Ultimately, this led me to reject the idea of using a digital calendar. Instead, I stuck with what I've always used, good old pen and paper. Until now. 

In an attempt to start a few projects, I find myself needing a way to dynamically schedule things. I want to dedicate blocks of time so I can work on things and the way I've always done isn't really working out for me. I find myself wanting reminders and scheduling reoccurring tasks. That's how the idea of using a digital calendar hit me.

It also occurred to me that I've been using my calendar the wrong way. Instead of only seeing it as a tool for scheduling meetings with others, as my job had conditioned me to, I can actually use it to schedule my own time. 

Hold on for a second and think about it, I can book my own time, schedule a meeting with myself, and dedicate a chunk of my time to myself for my own tasks. Doesn't that sound amazing? 

Most of you might already know that, but that's okay. This is news to me! It never occurred to me that I can book my own time. There's always this precedence other people have, it's like other people are the ones having the power to book your time, not you yourself. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence but for me, it might be because I'm one of the most junior employees, which caused me to subconsciously think that my superiors (and pretty much everyone else) have the right to tell me what to do and dictate how I should spend my time, which caused me to think less of my time and wield less authority over it. Interesting don't you think?

Another interesting point I want to make is that instead of creating a to-do list, try scheduling your tasks instead. The problem with to-do lists is that it's not very transparent how long it will take to finish all your tasks. You could have a list of just five tasks but two of those tasks might take you half a day each and you won't even realize it. Scheduling the tasks forces you to think how long they might take, you won't exactly be accurate or anything but the point is to give some thought to the time factor. Often, just by thinking about how long it will take will cause you to be aware of whether the task is manageable and whether you can finish everything on your to-do list.

The last thing you want is that you managed to check off every task on your to-do list except for one. This gives an illusion of progress until you realized that all the tasks you've checked off so far took a total of 3 hours to complete but the one task left remaining is going to take you another 3 hours of work.

Anyway, I've just started using Google calendars and tried scheduling a few stuff in. They have this cool feature called 'goals' where instead of making fixed plans on what to do, you can let Google do it for you. So far, it works pretty well and I've packed my evening with all sorts of tasks. This is only day one so I'm looking forward to how it will change my daily routine. 

The best part is, you can set several goals and tell Google how often you want to do them every week. After that, just let Google do its magic and watch as your calendar gets populated with your goals. Your tasks will magically shift around and you won't have to waste any mental energy deciding which task to do, just follow your schedule.

So my posting schedule is now dictated by my calendar, and I have completed one additional task done today.
