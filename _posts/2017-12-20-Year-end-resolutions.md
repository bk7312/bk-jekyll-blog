title: Make Year-end resolutions instead
---

Ever heard of Year-end resolutions? Unlike the New Year's resolution, which starts at the beginning of the year, the Year-end resolution starts at the end of the year. So, instead of having to keep your resolution for one full year, and fail horribly at it, you only need to keep it for a short few days/weeks and fail less horribly at it.

The idea came to me many nights ago when I was pondering in bed, unable to sleep. As I stare at the ceiling, a thought came to me. We, humans, are so great at making amazing long-term plans. The only thing we're bad at is following through with it. Sad isn't it? So many great plans gone to waste just because the person executing them can't stick to it for more than a few days. 

Now, what if we make short-term plans instead? It'll be magnitudes easier to stick with but the scope of what is achievable will be limited. We can get pretty good at something, i.e. chess, bird spotting or ice skating, in a year but to do it in a few weeks? Good luck. 

Then again, between giving up a year-long project at day 12 and succeeding at a week-long project, who cares if the result is limited. It doesn't mean that at the end of the week-long project we can't extend the project for another week or so. 

Succeeding at day 7 is better than failing at day 12, even though we might achieve more in the latter. By succeeding, we're giving ourselves a mental boost in confidence to tackle our next challenge. We now have one success to look back into as opposed to having one failure. The memory of a success is so much more empowering than a failure, is it not?

Seeing as how it's already December, I suddenly had this epiphany. What if, instead of waiting until New Year next year to make our resolutions, we make a Year-end resolution instead? Wouldn't that be a great way to end the year? By creating an awesome memory of having succeeded at something? Even if it's something simple like being able to play a few basic chords or a few simple scales on the piano.

Interestingly, there's also another way of looking at this. By doing short-term resolutions, we are forced to make effective use of our time. Long-term resolutions trick our brains into thinking we have all the time in the world so we behave very inefficiently and procrastinate a lot more.

The idea is not to do things fast and hastily but to clear out the inefficiencies and redundant stuff, make it straight to the point. Instead of telling yourself, 'I want to improve my 10K race time', ask yourself instead, 'How can I best improve my 10K race time in X weeks?', or even 'How many seconds can I shave off my 10K race time if I only have X weeks to train?'. 

This forces us to streamline our plan a lot. If we just want to improve our 10K race time, we'll procrastinate and waste time not being serious about it. Whereas if we force ourselves to a strict time constraint, we'll work at it a lot harder. Ironically, I'm starting to believe that constraints are the epitome of growth and creativity. 

You might not see much improvements in the above 10K example if X=1, but the memory of having succeeded in that challenge is powerful. Heck, you might even extend it for another week or so. Keep at it and before you know it, you're running faster and stronger than ever!

So what are you waiting for? Make your Year-end resolutions now and end the year strong with a BANG. Create an awesome memory this year-end and fuel yourself up for the challenge next year.

By the way, the word 'Epiphany' is my third favorite word that starts with an 'E'. My all-time favorite is 'Epitome', which rhymes with 'Epiphany'.
