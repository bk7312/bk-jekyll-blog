title: I just can't seem to binge watch any shows.
---

Quite a large number of people seem to like binge watching shows. I get that, it's a nice comfy way to spend the day just lazing around. You get to be fully immersed in the story with little to no breaks in between and the best part is, there's no need to wait for cliffhangers and whatnot. But somehow, I just can't do it.

I can't stand binge watching, it's like I have to stop after a while. There's always this dread I feel when someone recommends an already finished series. I pretty much see it as a chore, there's X episode of series Y to watch. Watching them all in one go feels like a drag and I'd seriously rather do something else. On the other hand, watching them an episode at a time feels slow and I'd sometimes lose track of where I was. Usually, my interest will slowly decay and I might end up dropping it prematurely. I also can't justify spending that amount of hours just watching something, it's weird.

Series that are currently airing on the other hand, I'm fine with. It's as if the only way to get me to watch something is by showing it or making it available only at certain times. Heck, I rather enjoy the delayed gratification from cliffhangers. It's like I can set myself to just watch, enjoy and move on. It's a bit like scheduled downtime, I get to enjoy the show and then carry on with whatever I was doing before and repeat this watch, enjoy and move on cycle until the series ends. 

Perhaps I'm just not as invested in series as most other people. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I can't stand sitting around (pun intended) watching something for extended periods and to be frank, this sometimes applies to long movies as well. 

Ironically, binge reading is something I'm totally fine with. There was even a time back in middle school where I actually read a book a day! Granted they were just over a hundred or so pages. It also didn't take me very long to finish a series of 7 books that gradually gets thicker and thicker. Now I've mostly transitioned to reading blog posts and some not-so-random articles online.

Perhaps it's a good thing I can't binge watch but am fully capable of binge reading. Not that it does any good to my eyes but it keeps me mentally active I guess. Kinda like active vs passive consumption if you will. Just a bit of food for thought on content consumption, it might be a good idea to review how you generally consume content and perhaps even the quality of what you consume as well. You might learn something new about yourself like I just did.
