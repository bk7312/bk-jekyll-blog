title: Thinking skills and what comes after
---

A few years ago, I took a course called "Thinking Skills" and it taught me many things. One of which was the concept of taking in multiple ideas and synthesizing them into an essay that critically evaluates all the ideas brought forth and come to a conclusion.  

The course would've been a lot of fun but the topics we were given were mostly debate topics with no clear-cut answers. They don't give us topics like whether the Earth is round or flat, or whether or not rain has any effect on permanently increasing sea level over the long term, or perhaps something fun like deducing how the victim was murdered inside a locked room and by which suspect. Instead, our topics are about gun laws, use of performance-enhancing drugs, ethnicity of abortions, and so on. 

Most of the time, the conclusion isn't satisfying. We're taught to sit on the fence, critically evaluate both sides, and avoid drawing strong conclusions unless there is sufficiently strong evidence supporting it. Not fun if you're very passionate about these topics, but it does teach you to be less extreme and explore what's on the other side of the coin.

Why am I bringing this up now? I was just reminiscing the good old days. Days where I don't have to spend the bulk of my day in the office doing office work. How I miss having classes, learning new things, and having the freedom to have fun and not be bounded by the stressful work life. Especially Thinking Skills, it was probably the single most unique class I've ever taken. It was so fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Taking multiple ideas and synthesizing them into new ones is just one part of the course. It also teaches lateral thinking, general analytical skills, learning how to interpret data and statistics, questioning the credibility and reliability of arguments and articles, finding flaws and hidden assumptions in various arguments, learning how to construct sound arguments, and etc. Truly a magnificent class.

Perhaps what I'm trying to say is this, I want to break free from where I'm currently at. When compared to where I was last time, the place I'm currently at sucks. That would be my conclusion and I would end this post here had I not taken Thinking Skills.

Instead, I would begin assessing the other side of the coin and counter with the fact that I'm earning instead of paying and that is quite a significant difference between back then and now. There are also a lot of other differences but I'll refrain from writing them down. There are also a couple of hidden assumptions and flaws in my thinking, such as the assumption that doing office work means I can't have fun or learn new things. I seem to also be implying that I can't change where I'm currently at and I haven't exactly defined why the place I'm currently at 'sucks'. 

In the end, what's my conclusion? That this is not a very well written argument? My reasoning isn't sound and is full of flaws? Let's not go in that direction. Instead, I'll ask myself, what am I going to do about it? What comes after having done all the assessment and evaluations? What happens after you draw a solid conclusion? 

You act on it. 

Yes, you act on it. It took me a while to realize this but what good is there in doing all that work coming to a conclusion, only to let it sit there and do nothing with it? Exactly! 

The thinking is over, I've gone past that phase a long time ago. I'm at a new stage in life and it's time to start taking action.
