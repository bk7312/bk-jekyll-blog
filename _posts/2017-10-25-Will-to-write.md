title: When the will to write isn't there anymore
---

What becomes of a writer that has lost the will to write? That when looking at the list of topics the writer has promised to write about, none seemed even remotely appealing to the writer's current state of mind. What then will the writer write? What then other than writing when the will to write has vanished. 

Writer's block, they call it. I don't believe it. There is no way a writer can stop writing, the writer is still thinking after all and when one still has thoughts running through one's mind, one can still write. It is only when the mind truly generates a blank does the writer loses the ability to write. Even then, a writer can start writing again simply by thinking. Yes, the writer simply has to write what goes in the mind. All is good, there's nothing to fear. 

When a writer writes what goes through the mind, it is only truly ever then that the writer is purely writing what the writer wishes to write. The writer is therefore not writing for compensation, nor is the writer writing to fulfill an agreement of sort. Write only what goes through the mind, for it is then when the writer will discover what lies within. 

Writing without an end in mind, writing itself becomes the end. The writer will simply engage in a never-ending process of writing the mind. Whatever that flows through the mind, what if ideas stopped flowing, what will become of our writer then? Writing itself is a creative art, there will never be a shortage of idea. What happens when the writer perceives a shortage is not due to a lack of ideas but rather, a lack perception and playfulness. 

Why does the writer write? What goes through the writer's mind when the writer becomes a writer? Can it simply be the desire to write? What purpose does that achieve? What meaning can there be in writing? The very core of which lies in having a voice and being heard. What could be more satisfying than sharing the wonderful thoughts that go through one's mind with the world? The ability to let others glimpse into one's mind, and conversely, to get a chance to glimpse into the minds of fellow writers. 

Whether a writer stays a writer or becomes the writer, it all boils down to how well the writer writes. How well the writer communicates an idea and how well the writer is able to engage the audience. If a writer simply writes to satisfy the mind, the writer writes to satisfy the minds of others in addition to the writer's mind. Writing is, after all, a tool to communicate ideas. A tool to facilitate the sharing of thoughts. 

Whenever a writer is at a loss for words, the writer can always come back and write the mind out. That, in itself, is the single most effective method of drawing the mind out. Enticing the mind to give out thoughts, any thoughts, for one thought often leads to another. Eventually, an idea interesting enough will form, of which the writer can happily write away. 

With that, the writer is once again reminded of the fact that some ideas might sound interesting to write about in one fleeting moment but when asked to write about the same idea in another fleeting moment, the idea has lost all freshness and doesn't sound as interesting anymore. Such is the dilemma for creative work.
