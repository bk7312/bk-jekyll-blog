title: Baseline habits
---

Here's something I've been experimenting since last week, the idea of having a set of baseline habits. Habits which I aim to do every day regardless of what's happening. Habits that are so ridiculously short and easy, they won't take up much time or effort.

Currently, this is what I have: 

* __Do a set of 10 push-ups, 10 squats, and 10 sit-ups.__ This takes less than a minute on average. Great for just maintaining fitness. If I ever feel pumped up for more, I can easily add more reps but this is the baseline that has to be done daily.
* __Sit, close my eyes and relax. Count my breaths from one to ten and repeat.__ Yes, meditation. This can take as long as I want it to and is generally done untimed but I aim to at least do 2 minutes. How do I keep track of time? Open my eyes every now and then and look at the clock, or stop whenever I feel like it if there's no clock.
* __Recall a few ukulele chords/scales or maybe even create a few from theory, and play them whenever possible. Also, do a quick set of finger stretching/strengthening exercises if I can't play.__ This takes about a minute or two but usually stretches longer once I take my ukulele out. As with any skill, it's important to keep at it. Even trying to recall what I already know is helpful, especially if it's a chord I rarely use. 

The key to these baseline habits is that they don't take long and can be done in a matter of minutes. For the above ones I have, it takes a minimum commitment of 5 minutes every day. That way, I can do them even on a busy day. They should also be independent of equipment and materials so ideally, they can be done anywhere and anytime.

So far, I've done a week's worth of this and I can feel my arms and legs getting stronger already, mainly because I've been doing way over the baseline set of push-ups, squats, and sit-ups this past couple of days. That's one advantage I overlooked when starting this, the fact that having a baseline habit encourages me to do more because the baseline is just so ridiculously easy. It's also very hard to justify not spending 5 minutes on this every day. That then creates a loop and I end up doing loads instead of the baseline. Just gotta be careful not to overdo it.

You know the old saying, a little goes a long way. I look forward to seeing how this simple baseline habit will turn out.
