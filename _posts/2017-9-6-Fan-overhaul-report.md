title: Fan overhaul report
---

Yesterday, the operator called and reported that the fan was operating noisily. After a preliminary inspection, it was found that the fan was vibrating axially along the shaft and the casing was hot to the touch. The machine in question is an overhung fan with a single stage axial flow design, driven by an electric motor. As it was not a critical machine, it was shut down and left for repair the next day. 

Based on the machine's history, it was commissioned several years ago and had never gone for any overhaul. Since it was a simple fan, there were no records of any preventive maintenance done on it and the strategy was always run-to-failure. The documentation available for the machine is also lacking, almost non-existent. The only data available were the operating instructions and some basic requirements. The data sheets, record sheets, and equipment manual could not be found. 

The fan was then removed from site and mobilized to the workshop where the technicians began disassembling it. The guard around the fan impeller was removed without difficulty and the condition of the impeller inspected, there were no findings aside from the usual dirt. Unfortunately, the impeller was difficult to turn by hand, indicating that the failure is likely on the bearings. 

Due to the design of this machine, it is only possible to open the motor from the drive end side, and since the fan is directly coupled to the motor as one unit, it is not possible to uncouple the fan to remove the motor drive end cover. Thus, the impeller lock nut had to be removed to take out the impeller before the motor drive end side can be accessible. Both the fan and motor casings are radial split.

After opening the motor casing, the bearings were found to be in a bad condition and grease can be seen coming out of it. Especially the bearing on the drive end side, it was stuck to the shaft. The non-drive end side bearing was significantly easier to remove but nevertheless, it was also stuck. Scoring can be seen on the both the shaft and the bearing. The recommendation from engineering is to replace the bearings and change to a new shaft. The impeller can be reused but balancing check has to be done on the whole rotor before installing it.

On the electric motor side, the condition of the stator seems to be acceptable but scratches can be seen running along on the rotor coils, indicating that there is some rubbing occurring. The turning gear for controlling the fan was also inspected, the high-speed gear was found to be slightly worn off and residues can be found beneath it. The low-speed gear looks to be in okay condition. A large amount of grease was also found to have accumulated around the high-speed gear teeth. Again, the recommendation is to replace the gear sets for the turning gear and rotor coils to be repaired. 

Since no spare parts were available, only minor cleaning and patching up was done. The bearing was cleaned and lubricated but not replaced due to parts unavailability. Against the advice and recommendation from engineering, no parts were replaced and nothing was repaired, aside from some basic cleaning, and assembly was done based on the steps taken during disassembly. The vendor was not contacted due to the nature and simplicity of the unit, as such, no service engineer was available to assist with the troubleshooting and assembly. 

On the quality side, no check sheets were used. Clearance check, dimensions, balancing, rotor magnetism, torque values, alignment, axial float, shaft run-out, backlash check, contact check and dye penetrant test for both the as-found condition and the as-installed condition were not taken. No deviations were recorded on the repair method and there was also no approval from the technical authority that the machine was fit for service after overhaul, or what was considered to be the overhaul. 

The machine was mobilized to site for a test run after assembly and despite the operator's insistence not to run the machine, the test run occurred without the operator's knowledge. The result: Fan failed to start. Suspect that either the cabling for the motor or the coils on the rotor/stator was tempered by accident during assembly or disassembly, hence the machine was unable to start. During function test, it was also found that the turning gear was not able to engage properly, likely due to a misalignment when reinstalling the gears. 

The newly overhauled fan was scrapped and a spare one was installed and commission on site. As with all the fan units installed, the maintenance philosophy was always run-to-failure and replace with new. Especially considering that this is not an industrial fan for boiler or cooling tower application but a simple household fan. It was fun while it lasted.
