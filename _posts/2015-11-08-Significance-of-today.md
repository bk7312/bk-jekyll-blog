title: What is the significance today, or any other day, holds?
---

Realistically speaking, today's date holds no value whatsoever other than letting people note how much time has passed. It is merely an indication of time based on the Earth's position relative to the sun. That's it really, nothing more nothing less. Yet, there's so much emphasis on special dates like historical events, anniversaries and etc. Especially new years. Why is that? What's so special about Earth being in the same position as last time when the event occurred, relative to the sun? As far as I can tell, there is none.

In the first place, how did people know when Earth has made one complete revolution around the sun? I don't know but I'm sure a quickly search online will reveal that question easy. But that's not the point here. The point is, I'm questioning the significance of celebrating an event that happened a few complete revolutions (AKA, years) ago, in intervals of a year and not months or weeks or etc instead. Why do we have to wait until the Earth is in the same position relative to the sun as last time before we can celebrate? Is there any significant meaning to this?

It's weird how I was pondering about this and then it hit me. I got it backwards. There isn't any significance in the date of such celebration. It is as it is, a mere indication of time. We are not celebrating the Earth reaching the same position again, relative to the sun. We are celebrating in remembrance to the time that passed. Again, the Earth's position is merely an indication of time, how did I not realize the significance of that sentence? I was so fixated on the significance of spacial position that I overlooked its purpose, to tell the time!

Yes, it's about time you realized that. The reason events or anniversaries are done in set intervals of a year isn't related to spacial position at all, it is merely the most convenient way, as far as we know, to remind ourselves of the events that transpired. Doing it in most other intervals would merely cause inconvenience, would it not? It is the context that gives it meaning, for without it, the date would be nothing but a mere measure of time.

So to answer your question, what is the significance today, or any other day, holds? I say that it is a reminder of what has come and what has passed. There is no reason why any one day is special, why the first day of the first month is special, it holds no meaning on its own. There is no significance in that day, it is the same as any other day.

Then let me ask, why is there so much fuss about special days, like the first day of the first month for example? Why couldn't it be any other day?

It is but an issue of convenience. A unified standard of sort.

Then, why are we bounded by such standards? Could we not challenge these standards, if they are called as such? And why is there a need to remind ourselves of what has happened?

As I have said, it is simply an issue of convenience. As the flow of time continues, we are reminded of the passage of time every single day as the date never stays the same. A standardized system is preferred in a sense to calibrate and align everyone's sense of time, if you will. Such celebrations or standards for celebrations generally apply to specific events that we might not want to forget, and as such, there is a need for a specific reminder.

And so, significance depends on context?

Yes, it only holds significance if you want it to. A belief of sort, if you will. Without context, nothing exists. To your scientific ways of reasoning things, such ideas may seem preposterous but the idea you had regarding spacial position, seriously?

Okay I get it. Fine, so in a way, it doesn't matter when such a celebration or reminder is done. It only matters if it is done with context right?

Right. Such gestures of appreciation matters not when, for that is not their purpose. What matters is the message or impact they deliver! That, my friend, is the take home message. Don't get too fixated on the wrong points, stop chasing things that matters little, give them up in exchange for those that do and you will find that things will be a lot easier.

It's weird how the date is just a placeholder and yet, so many people put so much weight in it. They seem to have forgotten that what matters is the content or context said date is supposed to bring.

Precisely. To that, I bid you farewell. May you fare well in the days to come. Perhaps someday, you will realize the significance of all this. The true significance that lies elsewhere.
