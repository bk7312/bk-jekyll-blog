title: Before we say goodbye.
---

Not a single tear was shed that night. It was the last farewell dinner we had as we ordered without a single care for what the bill might even remotely look like. It was a free-for-all, family-style, put everything in the center so everyone gets a piece of it, type of dinner.

The food was great, so were the drinks, but somehow, it didn't taste as great as it could be. We all ate our fill but even then, there were still lots of leftovers. Pictures were taken, words were exchanged and laughter was everywhere. Everyone went their separate ways after that, for we all knew we wouldn't be seeing each other anytime soon. At least, not until tomorrow morning.

To give the story a bit of context, it was the farewell dinner for the guy who has been managing me for almost a year, aka my boss. That night, several speeches were made, gifts presented and stories recounted. To him, I have to say, he has a lot of good points in his character. But perhaps equally so are his not-so-good points. Not to bad-mouth him or anything since no one is perfect. It seems like a farewell is the best time to finally reveal all the cards in one's hand. 

Leaving has this special privilege to it. The good gets amplified while the bad gets attenuated. Of course, why wouldn't it? There are quite a few statements that go like this: "I know I may be <insert personal bad quality here> but <insert good quality about others here> and that helped <insert good quality for self here>", and perhaps the more common one would be: "<Insert person here> might be <insert bad quality here> but <insert list of good qualities here>" or something along those lines. Just note the "may" and "might" for expressing bad qualities and the certainty when expressing good qualities.

Perhaps it's the feeling of loss that gives rise to this, the loss of someone who was once thought of a commodity and taken for granted. Now that that person is leaving, it creates an empty spot that just won't go away. A strong sense of loss or scarcity that perhaps led to the rise of this strong sense of gratitude and appreciation. Gratitude that would forgive almost anything and appreciation that can't help but sing praises. Truly, it is a magical moment.

As you're probably aware, the punchline was that we saw each other again the next morning or so. His final last day was actually a few days after the dinner and there's still a couple of admin stuff to be done.  There was another set of farewell handshakes given to a much wider audience, and that was the last interaction I had with him. A handshake and a genuine desire to see each other succeed in the journey that lies ahead of us. 

I guess the lesson is to know that someday, everyone will leave. We're all replaceable after all. What's important is to leave on a good note, finish strong and don't leave any regrets or bad feelings behind. Just think of all the people you're leaving behind and all the struggles they might face being one member short. 

That's something I haven't thought of and will likely remember for what's to come. People leaving isn't a rare sight nowadays and so far, the number of people I know who have left is roughly one per month, more if I include people I don't know. Of course, I'm totally ignoring the people who are joining, or replacing those who left, but that's another story. The important thing is to cheer those who left on their journey from here on out and perhaps we'll meet again someday in the future under very different circumstances. Surprising circumstances even. Circumstances that would make you proud or glad to have known them in the past. That's my goal anyway.

P.S - The title "Before we say goodbye" already exist as a novel about the events leading to an explosion as seen from the viewpoints of different characters. A film about a dying family member and a few songs by various different artists.
