title: The nameless story - Prologue.
---

Have you ever thought that someday, maybe just someday, you'll get to write a book and have it published for the world to read? Perhaps you don't, but that's okay, for I do and the idea has been swimming around my head for a while now. So without further ado, that "someday" begins today, right here, right now. Watch as my creativity flows and out comes my first ever masterpiece, or the prologue of said masterpiece anyway. Note, this is purely a work of fiction.

The glorious forest of the Hamarunian reserve. Home to the continent's most endangered species, and not to mention the world's most aggressive wildlife conservation group, the Institute of Hamarunian Wildlife, or IHW for short. Entry to the reserve has been strongly fortified and strictly regulated by IHW ever since that incident four years ago and the IHW headquarters is conveniently located just on the border of the forest reserve.

Adrian, a fresh graduate biologist, finds himself battling anxiety as nothing he said can convince the front desk receptionist to not call security and kick him out for the fifth time around. All he wanted to do was to speak with the organization's newest president, Dr. Wilona, and convince her that they should let him join as a trainee. At the very least, he wanted to speak with the human resource department but alas, they don't have one anymore.

Minutes later, a familiar yet comical scene whereby two burly men in pitch black suits and sunglasses can be seen dragging the reluctant Adrian out the building yet again. To the two security guards, they actually enjoyed kicking Adrian out the building. Not because it was fun to kick people out, there's that too of course, but it beats sitting in their office all day long with nothing to do. Maybe that's why they kept letting him sneak past despite being told not to let him in.

Standing under the hot scorching sun in front of the IHW's main building, Adrain thought once more whether he should try and sneak in again. The guards don't seem to mind, they even pretended not to see him. He just has to get past that pesky receptionist but the only way was to wait for her to leave her post. There's simply no blindspot for him to use. As much as Adrian wanted to join the organization, he figured it's probably best if he gives up now. Perhaps there was a reason why they haven't hire anyone for the past four years ever since the last president retired, not that the correlation implies a causation or anything. So much for getting a chance to see the near extinct national animal of Hamaruni. He might as well go home and rethink what he wants to do.

Just when Adrian was walking back to the carpark with his desolated spirit, Neville got off his car and did a quick final check of all the equipment in his bag. So far everything seems to be in place. He slung his bulky bag over his shoulders in a perfect arc and proceed with walking to the gate and was just about to enter the forest. He couldn't find his key card. Of all the things to forget, it had to be his key card. Cursing to himself, he went back to his car to have a quick look, maybe he accidentally left it there or something. The idea of having to waste another two hours just to drive home and back did not appeal to him, and neither did postponing his work until tomorrow. He could go to the main office and ask for a temporary key card but knowing how stringent his boss is, he seriously doubts that. Seeing as there's no other way around this, he went back in his car and drove off rather dangerously.

BEEEEEEEEP!! The startled Adrian jumped and tried to get out the way but it was over before he knew it. Fortunately, the car swerved and ran over a nearby shrub instead, obliterating most of it, and drove off as if nothing happened. Still panicked, he stood there frozen in fear for a few more seconds. 

"Woah, I could've died just now. Does this place have a grudge on me or something? Sigh... mental note to self: Don't ever walk mindlessly in the middle of the road ever again, doesn't matter if it's just a small road leading to a tiny carpark."

As Adrian walked, his pace slows down the closer he gets to his car. And he stood there, just meters away from his car dreading everything that happened today. Glancing at the dilapidated welcome sign next to the newly upgraded gate, he wondered if he'll ever be able to enter the reserve. Maybe someday, he thought. All around the perimeter, he noticed, were electric fences that stood tall and menacing. It just doesn't feel right to have such a heavily guarded forest reserve, even if it's the home to most of the continent's protected wildlife. Adrian stood there pondering, eyes lowered and looking on the ground in disappointment. He stared for a couple of minutes until out of nowhere, something caught his eye.

Among the leaves fallen on the ground, there's a piece of ribbon that camouflaged itself with the leaves. Upon closer inspection, it appears to be the neck strap for those ID card holders people wear around their neck. Adrian could never remember what they were called, the one he found appears to be someone's ID card. 

"N. Leroy, now who could that be?"

At the back, it says the usual "if found, please return to yada yada yada" and that happens to be the building Adrian was repeatedly kicked out of earlier. Adrian looked at the card and slowly shifted his glance to the gate. 

"What if... could it... it couldn't be... but it's worth a shot right?"

Overwhelmed by what his new-found options were, Adrian stood there paralyzed by choice. What should he do? What's the right thing to do? Is it worth trespassing into the reserve? Or is it better to return the card? What does he personally want to do? All these questions flashed through his mind, the only lingering thought he kept having was to go for it and he starts walking towards the gate.
