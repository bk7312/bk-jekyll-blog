## Jekyll Blog

This blog was originally created because I wanted a hassle-free way to create and maintain a static site. So I forked [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and deployed it in bk7312.github.io using GitHub Pages.

But since I'm planning to use bk7312.github.io for something else, I have removed this blog from GitHub Pages and, after much struggle, deployed it in [Vercel](https://bk-jekyll-blog.vercel.app/) instead.
