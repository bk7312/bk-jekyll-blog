This blog was originally created because I wanted a hassle-free way to create a static site, so I forked [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and deployed it at bk7312.github.io. 

But since I'm planning to use bk7312.github.io for something else, I have removed this blog from github pages. I might try to re-deploy it elsewhere, but since I'm not really familiar with jekyll and ruby/gem, I will either leave it as it is, or switch to another static site generator.
